# Flowmodoro

This is a side project of mine. 

My version of the Flowmodoro is a timer designed to help maintain focus based on the concept of flow. This timer is specifically intended to help you concentrate and track your breaks according to the duration of your focused work. Unlike Pomodoro timer, this is useful to keep focus and while counting the break according to how long you have been focusing on.
